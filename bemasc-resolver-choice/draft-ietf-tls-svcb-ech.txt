   Bootstrapping TLS Encrypted ClientHello with DNS Service Bindings
                     draft-ietf-tls-svcb-ech-latest

Abstract

   To use TLS Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) the client needs to learn the
   ECH configuration for a server before it attempts a connection to the
   server.  This specification provides a mechanism for conveying the
   ECH configuration information via DNS, using a SVCB or HTTPS record.

1.  Overview

   The Service Bindings framework [SVCB] allows server operators to
   publish a detailed description of their service in the Domain Name
   System [RFC1034] using SVCB or HTTPS records.  Each SVCB record
   describes a single "alternative endpoint", and contains a collection
   of "SvcParams" that can be extended with new kinds of information
   that may be of interest to a client.  Clients can use the SvcParams
   to improve the privacy, security, and performance of their connection
   to this endpoint.

   This specification defines a new SvcParam to enable the use of TLS
   Encrypted ClientHello [ECH] in TLS-based protocols.  This SvcParam
   can be used in SVCB, HTTPS or any future SVCB-compatible DNS records,
   and is intended to serve as the primary bootstrap mechanism for ECH.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  SvcParam for ECH configuration

   The "ech" SvcParamKey is defined for conveying the ECH configuration
   of an alternative endpoint.  It is applicable to all schemes that use
   TLS-based protocols (including DTLS [RFC9147] and QUIC version 1
   [RFC9001]) unless otherwise specified.

   In wire format, the value of the parameter is an ECHConfigList
   (Section 4 of [ECH]), including the redundant length prefix.  In
   presentation format, the value is the ECHConfigList in Base 64
   Encoding (Section 4 of [RFC4648]).  Base 64 is used here to simplify
   integration with TLS server software.  To enable simpler parsing,
   this SvcParam MUST NOT contain escape sequences.

4.  Server behavior

   When publishing a record containing an "ech" parameter, the publisher
   MUST ensure that all IP addresses of TargetName correspond to servers
   that have access to the corresponding private key or are
   authoritative for the public name.  (See Section 7.2.2 of [ECH] for
   more details about the public name.)  Otherwise, connections will
   fail entirely.

   These servers SHOULD support a protocol version that is compatible
   with ECH.  At the time of writing, the compatible versions are TLS
   1.3, DTLS 1.3, and QUIC version 1.  If the server does not support a
   compatible version, each connection attempt will have to be retried,
   delaying the connection and wasting resources.

5.  Client behavior

   This section describes client behavior in using ECH configurations
   provided in SVCB or HTTPS records.

5.1.  Disabling fallback

   The SVCB-optional client behavior specified in (Section 3 of [SVCB])
   permits clients to fall back to a direct connection if all SVCB
   options fail.  This behavior is not suitable for ECH, because
   fallback would negate the privacy benefits of ECH.  Accordingly, ECH-
   capable SVCB-optional clients MUST switch to SVCB-reliant connection
   establishment if SVCB resolution succeeded (as defined in Section 3
   of [SVCB]) and all alternative endpoints have an "ech" SvcParam.

5.2.  ClientHello construction

   When ECH is in use, the TLS ClientHello is divided into an
   unencrypted "outer" and an encrypted "inner" ClientHello.  The outer
   ClientHello is an implementation detail of ECH, and its contents are
   controlled by the ECHConfig in accordance with [ECH].  The inner
   ClientHello is used for establishing a connection to the service, so
   its contents may be influenced by other SVCB parameters.  For
   example, the requirements related to ALPN protocol identifiers in
   Section 7.1.2 of [SVCB] apply only to the inner ClientHello.
   Similarly, it is the inner ClientHello whose Server Name Indication
   (SNI) identifies the desired service.

5.3.  Performance optimizations

   Prior to retrieving the SVCB records, the client does not know
   whether they contain an "ech" parameter.  As a latency optimization,
   clients MAY prefetch DNS records that will only be used if this
   parameter is not present (i.e. only in SVCB-optional mode).

   The "ech" SvcParam alters the contents of the TLS ClientHello if it
   is present.  Therefore, clients that support ECH MUST NOT issue any
   TLS ClientHello until after SVCB resolution has completed.  (See
   Section 5.1 of [SVCB]).

6.  Interaction with HTTP Alt-Svc

   HTTP clients that implement both HTTP Alt-Svc [RFC7838] and the HTTPS
   record type [SVCB] can use them together, provided that they only
   perform connection attempts that are "consistent" with both sets of
   parameters (Section 9.3 of [SVCB]).  At the time of writing, there is
   no defined parameter related to ECH for Alt-Svc.  Accordingly, a
   connection attempt that uses ECH is considered "consistent" with an
   Alt-Svc Field Value that does not mention ECH.

   Origins that publish an "ech" SvcParam in their HTTPS record SHOULD
   also publish an HTTPS record with the "ech" SvcParam for every alt-
   authority offered in its Alt-Svc Field Values.  Otherwise, clients
   might reveal the name of the server in an unencrypted ClientHello to
   an alt-authority.

   If all HTTPS records for an alt-authority contain "ech" SvcParams,
   the client MUST adopt SVCB-reliant behavior (as in Section 5.1) for
   that RRSet.  This precludes the use of certain connections that Alt-
   Svc would otherwise allow, as discussed in Section 9.3 of [SVCB].

7.  Security Considerations

   A SVCB RRSet containing some RRs with "ech" and some without is
   vulnerable to a downgrade attack: a network intermediary can block
   connections to the endpoints that support ECH, causing the client to
   fall back to a non-ECH endpoint.  This configuration is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Zone owners who do use such a mixed configuration
   SHOULD mark the RRs with "ech" as more preferred (i.e. lower
   SvcPriority value) than those without, in order to maximize the
   likelihood that ECH will be used in the absence of an active
   adversary.

   In an idealized deployment, ECH protects the SNI with an anonymity
   set consisting of all the ECH-enabled server domains supported by a
   given client-facing server.  Accordingly, an attacker who can
   enumerate this set can always guess the encrypted SNI with
   probability 1/K, where K is the number of domains in the set.  In
   practice, this probability may be increased via traffic analysis,
   popularity weighting, and other mechanisms.

   ECH ensures that TLS does not disclose the SNI, but the same
   information is also present in the DNS queries used to resolve the
   server's hostname.  This specification does not conceal the server
   name from the DNS resolver.  If DNS messages are sent between the
   client and resolver without authenticated encryption, an attacker on
   this path can also learn the destination server name.  A similar
   attack applies if the client can be linked to a request from the
   resolver to a DNS authority.

   An attacker who can prevent SVCB resolution can deny clients any
   associated security benefits.  A hostile recursive resolver can
   always deny service to SVCB queries, but network intermediaries can
   often prevent resolution as well, even when the client and recursive
   resolver validate DNSSEC and use a secure transport.  These downgrade
   attacks can prevent a client from being aware that "ech" is
   configured which could result in the client sending the ClientHello
   in cleartext.  To prevent downgrades, Section 3.1 of [SVCB]
   recommends that clients abandon the connection attempt when such an
   attack is detected.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is instructed to modify the Service Parameter Keys Registry
   entry for "ech" as follows:

      +========+======+====================+===========+============+
      | Number | Name | Meaning            | Format    | Change     |
      |        |      |                    | Reference | Controller |
      +========+======+====================+===========+============+
      | 5      | ech  | TLS Encrypted      | (This     | IETF       |
      |        |      | ClientHello Config | document) |            |
      +--------+------+--------------------+-----------+------------+
